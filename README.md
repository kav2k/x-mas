X-Mas: Christmas Revenge
===

Santa stopped being nice and sends his minions forth! Can you stop the invading forces of Christmas?
This humorous mod adds some Xmas spirit into the game by changing alien sprites and descriptions to make them more jolly!

Still a work in progress, currently converted:

Sectoids -> Santoids
More perhaps to come.

This mod is compatible with OpenXcom nightly, and shouldn't conflict with other mods (it doesn't add or significantly change anything, only images and strings).

Big thanks to Meridian for help with general resource modding.
